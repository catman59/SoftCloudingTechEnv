# SoftCloudingTechEnv
This could be a first interproject. Developing SoftClouds, for scientific purposes the main being SuperConductivity.
What are SoftClouds, well I believe that cloud networking isn't just hardware based, it's also logic based. Imagine if you will a 
Software Cloud for world peace, an extreme example I know. But consider all the policy and red tape at summit's, where it still can't be
decided what a true negotiation is, due to the unforseen. A SoftCloud in this instance could iron out all those creases and leave no
doubt to the entities mission without any backtracing out of the agreed and proposed policies. A SoftCloud for SuperConductivity could 
protect and preserve all the inputs from all who participated within this endeavor. For example some crazy thought or imagined scenario,
from a junior in the field, that smashes the solution. Doesn't become lost to some ego chasing a Nobel Peace Prize. People with the aid
of a properly used technology shouldn't feel the need to hide their creativity due to greed and supremacy.
